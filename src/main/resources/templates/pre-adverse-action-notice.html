<p>Dear <span th:text="${name}">John Smith</span>,</p>

<p>
    You recently authorized checkr-bpo (“the company”) to obtain consumer reports and/or investigate consumer reports about you from a consumer reporting agency.
    The Company is considering taking action based on the following charges:
</p>

<form>
    <ul>
        <li th:each="charge : ${charges}">
            <label>
                <input th:if="${edit}" type="checkbox"> <span th:text="${charge}">Charge Name</span>
                <span th:if="${!edit}" th:text="${charge}">Charge Name</span>
            </label>
        </li>
    </ul>
</form>

<p>
    If you wish to dispute the accuracy of the information in the report directly with the consumer reporting agency
    (i.e., the source of the information contained in the report), you should contact the agency identified above directly.
</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Checkr-bpo</p>
